This is a simple blog site bootstraped with NextJS and TailwindCSS. Created in order to complete assignment challenge for FE position at [Deall](https://usedeall.com). The site design heavily inspired by [GeistUI](https://geist-ui.dev/en-us).

## Getting Started

_Make sure you already had NodeJS ver >= 14 installed_.

- First, clone this repo.
- Second, install dependency, by default I'm using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). (_It's encouraged to use pnpm_) But still you can use any package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

```bash
pnpm install
# or
yarn
# or
npm install
```

- Third, copy `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill the line with required config mentioned in the `.env.example` file.
- Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
